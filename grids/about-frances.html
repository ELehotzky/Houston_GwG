          I'm a chemical engineer by training and trade with an avid interest in learning programming in her free time.
        </p>
        <p class="profiletext-p">
          I've had some experience with Java and Matlab from prior coursework and school/work projects. Over the course of the past year or so, I started learning Python, GoLang, basic computer architecture, and data structures through online resources, friends, and projects. All of the related internet search history led to numerous targeted ads from Facebook about a Grow with Google scholarship through Udacity. Although I started out primarily interested in learning back-end development, I figured it never hurts to explore potential new interests and applied anyways.
        </p>
        <p class="profiletext-p">
          The Udacity course has been a wonderful experience. I've gained exposure to a broad range of concepts and found a community of driven individuals to study with and learn from.
        </p>
        <p class="profiletext-p">
          An unexpected (but entirely welcome!) side effect of my adventures in front-end development has been discovering new avenues for my passion for art. I've always had a lifelong love for traditional art media, and after seeing the opportunities that could open up if I ventured into digital art, I decided to give that a try! The skyline banner and portrait sketches on this website are the result of a number of hours and my newly acquired Wacom tablet.
