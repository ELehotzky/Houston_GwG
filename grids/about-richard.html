        <p class = "about_p">
          My background is in cultural anthropology, but I have always been fascinated by tech. In college, I did research on player goals and motivations in World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online game. I presented my research at the 7th Annual SAGE Student Research Conference in 2015. My interests go beyond the social aspects of computing: I began studying front-end web development through Udacity’s Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship.

          My interests go beyond the social aspects of computing: I began studying front-end web development through Udacity’s Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. After three months, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Now, my goal is to hone my skills by utilizing resources I learned during the course to develop a better understanding of building attractive, interactive websites.

          Currently, I am finishing the Grow with Google Front-End Web Developer Challenge. I began the CSS course on Codecademy to reinforce what I learned from Udacity. Afterward, I plan on trying #30daysofjavascript to improve my skills in the language. My journey in learning to code began in January; yet my adventure’s just begun thanks to the supportive community I met through the scholarship.
