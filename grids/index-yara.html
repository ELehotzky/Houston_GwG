               <p>I am a dental lab technician with a new passion for web development.</p>
               <br>
               <p>My curiosity for web development started in 2016, when I read a post on medium about the flexibility and the high demand of web developers. Since then, I began to explore more about the subject and connecting with other developers and newbies on Twitter. Soon I discover there were many amazing free resources such as freecodeCamp, CodeAcademy, Udemy and others, but I was constantly finding myself stuck and unmotivated. I was missing a key ingredient, and that was engaging in a community. Many months passed without much progress on my end. Until the end of last year, I saw a tweet from one of my fellow newbies. He got accepted into the Google Web developer challenge! That tweet motivated me to apply for this year and voilà! I got accepted. </p>   
               <br>
               <p>The Google Scholarship program has been and amazing experience for me. It helped me in many ways I couldn’t imagine before. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery are not foreign languages anymore. the community is very dynamic and supportive. </p>
