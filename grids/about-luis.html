<!--					<h2>Who I Am</h2>-->
					<p>
						Welcome,
					</p>
					<p>
						I majored in Digital Media - Game Design track and focused a lot of my college career and early efforts in art. Shortly after graduating I got a contract job EA Tiburon where I worked as a Stability Analyst for a year. The core of my job was essentially ensuring that the code base remained stable. It was my time and exposure at this job that convinced me software engineering was the career path I ultimately wanted to take.
					</p>
					<p>
						Previously I got exposure to programming from college courses and work I had done on my own, but nothing really stuck and very little clicked. Going through codecademy.com and lynda.com for python and committing to the process helped me finally understand core programming concepts. I worked to complete python coursework on both those platforms and began to venture into freecodecamp. Once I completed the python courses I went full swing into beginning my journey on front-end development. This scholarship program was a wonderful opportunity to continue my software development journey.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am extremely grateful for all the interactions I’ve had during the challenge scholarship and especially the #houston community group I’ve worked with. It has been awesome to have a peer group all motivated and learning in the same area.
					</p>
					<p>
						Check out my portfolio and connect with me!
					</p>

Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”
