            My passion for learning transcends borders. I've sought out and been lucky to have a range of experiences from bartending to navigating chemical plants to working on oil rigs off the shore of Saudi Arabia. 
          <p class="profiletext-p-fc">
            As a kid, I made sure to stay on the cutting edge of technology (or at least, as creatively near the cutting edge as an elementary school student with access to Linux and basic graphing calculators can be). I was proficient with PHP and HTML in the pre-MySpace days and even had a (very) small business in middle school making websites within my community. I’ve programmed in Java before and now I work with PLC’s and DCS/SCADA systems from multiple angles.

          <p class="profiletext-p-fc">
            You can usually find me playing around with Raspberry Pi’s and various AIY kits to try and automate the everyday things in my life. I'm also in the process of learning cloud architecture and computer science theory both for fun and to be able to fully leverage my skills. 
          </p>
          <p class="profiletext-p-fc">
            I’m always open to connecting about new projects or just for general conversation, so please reach out!
