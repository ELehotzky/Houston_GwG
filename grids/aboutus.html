          In January 2018, Phase I of Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google">Grow with Google Scholarship</a> started again. A group of us in the front-end track located near Houston started meeting up every week. During the first meeting, many people expressed interest in starting a group project for all of us to better learn the material and also learn beyond the course. The result of that is this website.
        </p>
        <p class = "aboutus_p">
          Between the ten of us, there were a lot of interests in addition to the course material. We took some of those interests: art, design, back-end type functionality using front-end, APIs, maps, and the human component, and combined them with the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery skills that we learned from Udacity to create this website.

          Please click around and explore what we've been up to! Links to individual members' profile pages, individual portfolios included, are on the homepage and can also be accessed via the map of Houston scholars.
