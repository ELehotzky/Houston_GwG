        <p class = "about_p">
          I began my career in 2008 as a writer and copy editor in print media in Nigeria, West Africa. Over time, I have seized various opportunities that have enabled me to build capacity as writer, media strategist, and project manager specifically in the field of media and communications.
          But the world of the media as we know it continues to change so rapidly. Marshall McLuhan's 1964 assertion that <i><a href="http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"target="_blank">Medium is the Message</a></i>  seems truer today than when the idea was first propagated. 
          Web technology today dictates meaning and this is true of our <a href="http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_Word-Up-02_Influences-on-21st-Century-Language_Mark-McCrindle.pdf"target="_blank">lexicon</a>, 
          building (bi)partisan communities through <a href="http://time.com/4783932/inside-russia-social-media-war-america/"target="_blank">the power of algorithm</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-great-transformer"target="_blank">powering solutions in the world of business</a>.
          This awareness, and a need to upskill after relocation to the States, led me to register for Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001"target="_blank">Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program</a>, after I spotted the Google scholarship AD on Facebook.

        <p class = "about_p">
          With Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001"target="_blank">Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program</a>, I have learnt the two core technologies for building web pages: HTML, and CSS, along with my first object-oriented web programming language, JavaScript. 
          I continue to build on the skills through collaborative effort. The Houston team and Udacity's virtual student community are made up of people with varying levels of experience in computer programming and we get the chance to work on projects together. This is my first collaborative effort. 
          Working with the Houston team has been both enlightening and empowering. My next goal is to test these skills by taking on a personal project (watch this space for updates) as a way to build expertise.
